Overall I thought this project was extremely hard. I was very new to all of this
material and found it challenging to teach myself. Regardless I spent many hours
working on this assignment. I have completed making the data structure to store
the object’s loaded from the JSON. This was super challenging to figure out because
I had never worked with .json files before. But I was able to figure it out.
I also was able to wire the json objects’ image file into my page. Doing this
required me to randomize the alphabet given and then use javascript to create
the html code on the fly. This was also challenging to figure out. I completed
all of that as well as figuring out how to work with droppable jquery functions. 
I wasn’t able to implement any of the game scoring aspect of this project because
i was too focused on the other more fundamental parts of this project.

I intend to use my last HW token on this assignment.
